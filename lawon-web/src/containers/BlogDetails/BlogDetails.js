                                    <p>Going through a divorce is never an enjoyable experience. There’s always bound to be a great deal of stress and emotional turmoil involved; feelings which are exacerbated by legal disputes as you and your partner begin halving your possessions. However, you can’t allow any legal battles to make you lose sight of one very important fact- it’s <em>you</em> that’s getting a divorce, not your children.</p>
                            <p>Parenting at this time is notoriously tough, as you need to offer your children a certain sense of reassurance, while also trying to keep them away from the divorce proceedings. When children are involved, it’s imperative that your divorce runs as smoothly as possible, so that they don’t end up getting caught in the middle and ultimately end up feeling guilty about the whole situation.</p>
                            <p>We always recommend seeking legal advice when going through a divorce; but, for now, we’ve put together some top tips on parenting throughout this difficult time.</p>
                            <h2>Have Some Fun With Them</h2>
                            <p>As we’ve previously said, divorce proceedings are never going to be enjoyable. There can be all kinds of legal complications involved, which only grow more convoluted as you continue to argue with your ex-partner. However, as a parent, it’s imperative that you don’t forget to have a little fun with your children at this point.</p>
                            <p>No matter how tricky your divorce is proving to be, you need to do your best to keep your children away from it all. The most effective way to do this is to play games with them, take them on trips they’ll enjoy, and so forth. This should by no means turn into a competition between you and your ex- instead, this is your way of showing your children that everything will be okay.</p>
                            <p>Ultimately, connecting with your children like this will make the divorce much easier on all of you.</p>
                            <h2>Implement A Routine</h2>
                            <p>For many divorces, one of the biggest concerns is the custody of any children. First and foremost, you need to make sure these new arrangements (whatever they may be) provide them with a routine they can grow accustomed to. If things turn a little ad-hoc and the children are never quite sure where they’ll be staying the next night, then this will ultimately make life too chaotic for them.</p>
                            <p>This is why it’s so important for your solicitor to make sure that any custody arrangements are clear as water, so that everyone involved knows exactly what’s going to happen without any ambiguity.</p>
                            <h2>Make The Decisions Yourself</h2>
                            <p>When going through a divorce, some parents will actually ask their children who they would like to stay with, rather than coming to an agreement between themselves. You might think that this is a fantastic way to make sure your children are happy with the outcome of your divorce, but the fact is that asking a child to make such a big decision is just too much pressure.</p>
                            <p>Although you might feel as though you’re doing the right thing, asking your children to answer such a question is essentially a way of passing the buck. You need to decide their future between yourself and your ex-partner, because they’ll end up struggling with guilt no matter who they choose to stay with.</p>
                            <p>Here at LawOn, we’re keen to make sure that your divorce runs as smoothly as possible, which is why we’ve developed a <a href="https://lawon.co.uk/">free legal advice app</a>. Available on both Android and iOS, our app makes it easier than ever for you to speak to a solicitor and receive the advice you need.</p>
